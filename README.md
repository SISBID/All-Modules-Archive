## Information for Instructors 
Instructors are recommended to clone the repository instead of downloading all files as a .zip file. This will import all tags and repo history.

To add tags (release version in Github) we require the following: 
```shell
# Create a tag for a specific commit
# We do not require the full SHA here
git tag [tagname] [commit SHA]

# Pushing tags to Github will require adding an option to the `push` command
git push --tags
```
